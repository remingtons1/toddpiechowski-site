## Writing Guidelines

1. **Length**: 500-800 words. Enough to say something, short enough to read.

2. **Voice**: Editorial, personal. Not corporate. Write like you're explaining to a smart friend.

3. **Structure**:
   - Hook in first line
   - One big idea per post
   - Subheads for scannability
   - End with a takeaway or action

4. **Avoid**:
   - "In this post, we'll explore..."
   - Listicles (unless genuinely useful)
   - AI slop phrases
   - Hedging ("might," "could," "possibly")

5. **Include**:
   - Specific examples
   - Your actual experience (Horizon Shelf, brands you've worked with)
   - Contrarian takes when you have them
   - Links to previous posts when relevant

## Repurposing

Each post becomes:
- 1 Twitter/X thread (key points)
- 1 LinkedIn post (adapted for that audience)
- Content for the book's second edition
- Potential newsletter if you start one

---

## Notes

- Posts 1-14 are foundational. Someone could read just these and understand the space.
- Posts 15-21 (protocols) are more technical. Good for establishing expertise.
- Posts 22-35 (product data, visibility) are most actionable for brands.
- Posts 36-42 (conversion) are the money posts — this is what brands pay for.
- Posts 50-56 are implementation guides that could become lead magnets.

Start with Week 1. Ship daily. Adjust based on what resonates.
